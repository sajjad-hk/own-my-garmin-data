# garmin-data

Pulls your Garmin Connect data (activities, daily health metrics,
training insight, challenges, badges) into your own private Postgres
database. You gather it, you own it, you query it — with plain SQL,
no special tooling required.

**Important: this is per-person.** Each person needs their own copy of
this repo, their own free Neon database, and their own Garmin login
token. You can't share a database or token between two Garmin accounts
— set it up independently for each person.

## What you'll need before starting

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — installs Python itself if needed, no
  separate Python/pip/venv setup:
  - macOS/Linux: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
  - Windows: `powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`
- Your own Garmin Connect account (email + password, and your phone/email
  handy if you have two-factor/MFA enabled on it)
- A free [Neon](https://neon.tech) account (Postgres database, no credit
  card needed for the free tier)
- `git` installed, to download the code
- The [`gh`](https://cli.github.com) CLI, logged in (`gh auth login`) — used
  to set your repo's Actions secrets and trigger the initial backfill

Setup takes about 10 minutes the first time.

## Setup

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd garmin-data
uv run install.py
```

This one command: connects to your Neon database, applies the schema, walks
you through Garmin login (masked password, MFA-aware, retries on a wrong
password/code), pushes your GitHub Actions secrets via `gh`, and triggers
the full-history backfill to run on GitHub's servers — nothing long-running
happens on your own machine.

Before running it, create a **Neon project** (any name) — its default
connection string is your `DATABASE_URL`. `uv run install.py` will prompt
for it.

Push this repo to your own GitHub account (make your own copy/fork, not a
shared one) *before* running `install.py`, so it can detect the repo and set
its secrets automatically.

### Choosing what gets synced

`install.py` asks which data domains to sync (activities, daily wellness,
body composition, training & performance, challenges & badges, profile —
all on by default) and stores the choice in the database itself
(`sync_config.enabled_domains`), so both your local wizard and the GitHub
Actions runners see the same selection without a new secret.
`reproductive` health (menstrual calendar, pregnancy) exists in the
registry but isn't implemented yet — it stays off until its endpoints are
verified against a live account, and isn't offered in the checklist until
then.

Non-interactive setup: `uv run install.py --domains activities,wellness,training`
(or set `GARMIN_DOMAINS`).

### Adding domains later

Already set up and want to turn on something new (or pick up new data
that landed inside a domain you already have)? Run:

```bash
uv run install.py --upgrade
```

It shows what's new, lets you adjust your domain selection, applies any
pending schema, and triggers a backfill scoped to just what you added —
existing domains and data are untouched.

### Re-authenticating later

If you ever change your Garmin password (or a token just stops working),
re-run the same login flow on its own:

```bash
uv run install.py --reauth
```

### Prefer to do it by hand?

Each piece the wizard automates is also runnable individually —
`uv run apply_schema.py` (see "Schema" below — the bare command only
applies base tables; use `install.py`/`install.py --upgrade` to also
apply your chosen domains' migrations),
`uv run bootstrap/generate_token.py`,
`uv run bootstrap/load_token_to_db.py`, `uv run ingestion/pull.py` (a
one-off incremental pull, same code the daily sync runs), `uv run
backfill.py` (full history — expect hours, safe to stop/resume), and
`.github/workflows/backfill.yml` (trigger it from the Actions tab).

### Schema

`apply_schema.py` now runs the migration files under `schema/migrations/`
(each tagged to one domain) instead of a single `schema/init.sql` — see
`docs/garmin_api_coverage.md`'s "Data domains" section. Run bare, it
only applies the base migration (`auth_tokens`, `sync_config`,
`schema_migrations`); applying a domain's tables requires passing your
enabled domains, which `install.py` and `install.py --upgrade` do for
you.

## Querying your data

This is the whole point: it's just Postgres. Connect with any Postgres
client (`psql "$DATABASE_URL"`, a GUI like TablePlus, or a script) and
query it directly.

Your 10 most recent activities:

```sql
select activity_id, started_at
from activities
order by started_at desc
limit 10;
```

Steps, distance, and resting heart rate for the last two weeks:

```sql
select metric_date,
       stats ->> 'totalSteps'          as steps,
       stats ->> 'totalDistanceMeters' as distance_m,
       stats ->> 'restingHeartRate'    as resting_hr
from daily_metrics
order by metric_date desc
limit 14;
```

Most tables here store Garmin's raw JSON response in a `jsonb` column
(`raw` on `activities`, `stats`/`sleep`/`hrv`/etc. on `daily_metrics`) —
see `schema/migrations/` for the full table list and
`docs/garmin_api_coverage.md` for what each Garmin API method maps to.
Postgres's `->>` (get JSON field as text) and `->` (get JSON field as
JSON) operators let you reach into those payloads from plain SQL.

### Want Claude to be able to query this for you?

See the separate [`postgres-mcp`](#) project (fill in your link) — it's
a small, standalone MCP server you point at this same database, using a
read-only role you create there. It's optional and lives outside this
repo entirely; this repo doesn't need it, describe, or embed any part of
it.

## Automatic daily syncing (no computer needs to stay on)

This uses GitHub Actions to run the sync automatically every day, on
GitHub's servers rather than your own machine.

`uv run install.py` already pushed this repo's `NEON_DATABASE_URL` (and
optional `NTFY_TOPIC`, for a push notification if a sync fails — subscribe
to that same topic name in the free [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) app) as repo
secrets, and triggered the initial backfill. From here:

- It runs automatically on its own schedule (currently daily) — nothing
  else to do.
- Trigger it manually any time from the **Actions** tab → `garmin-sync` →
  **Run workflow**.
- Didn't run through the wizard, or want to double-check the secret got
  set? **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** in your repo.

### Triggering a backfill manually

The initial history backfill runs automatically as part of `install.py`,
but you can re-trigger it any time — e.g. to pull further back, or to
retry after a failure — from the **Actions** tab → `garmin-backfill` →
**Run workflow** (optionally set a start date). It's safe to re-run:
`backfill.py` skips dates it's already pulled.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `uv: command not found` | Re-run the install line for your OS from "What you'll need," then open a new terminal |
| `KeyError: 'DATABASE_URL'` | `.env` isn't set up — re-run `uv run install.py`, or set `DATABASE_URL` yourself |
| `relation "..." does not exist` | Re-run `uv run install.py --upgrade` to apply any pending migrations for your enabled domains (bare `apply_schema.py` only applies base tables) |
| `429` / rate limited during login | Wait a few minutes before retrying — Garmin temporarily blocks repeated login attempts |
| `MFA Required` | Your account has two-factor enabled; `install.py`/`generate_token.py` will prompt for the code — make sure you're ready to receive it |
| `gh: command not found` / not authenticated | Install `gh` and run `gh auth login`, then re-run `uv run install.py` — or follow the manual secret-setup instructions it prints |

## A few honest caveats

- This uses an **unofficial** Python library (`garminconnect`) that mimics
  Garmin's own app, since Garmin's official developer program isn't open
  to individuals. It generally works well but can break if Garmin changes
  something on their end — if a sync suddenly fails, that's the most
  likely cause.
- Keep sync frequency reasonable (this is already set up to run once a
  day) — hammering Garmin's login endpoint risks your account getting
  temporarily flagged.
